# hospital-app

This repository contains a hospital management application developed as part of my learning process. 
The application utilizes Spring Boot, Spring Security, 
PostgreSQL, Thymeleaf, and Hibernate ORM to create a 
useful tool for hospital management.

## Overview

The hospital management system includes features for doctors, patients, 
and admins, providing each with a dedicated interface to manage their tasks.

## Key Features

- **Doctor Page**: Doctors can manage their appointments and input procedural information along with costs.
- **Patient Page**: Patients can view their visit history, including the doctors they visited and the procedures performed.
- **Admin Page**: Admins can register new patients and schedule appointments with selected doctors.
- **Super Admin Page**: Super admins have CRUD functionalities for doctors, patients, and specialties.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Spring Boot
- **Security**: Spring Security
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: Thymeleaf
- **ORM**: Hibernate ORM

## How It Works

1. **Doctor Page**: 
   - Doctors can log in to view and manage their appointments.
   - They can add procedural details and costs for each patient visit.

2. **Patient Page**:
   - Patients can log in to view their visit history.
   - They can see details about the doctors they visited and the procedures performed.

3. **Admin Page**:
   - Admins can register new patients and schedule their appointments with doctors.

4. **Super Admin Page**:
   - Super admins can perform CRUD operations on doctors, patients, and specialties.

## Learning Outcomes

Through developing this project, I have gained a deep understanding of implementing Spring Security in a web application. 
This project helped me practice and refine my skills in creating secure and 
efficient hospital management systems using modern web technologies.
